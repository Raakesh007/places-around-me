        <br>
        "Petrol bunk" is a colloquial term used in India to refer to a petrol pump, which is a facility where petrol and other fuels are sold to the public.
        The word "bunk" is derived from the British English word "bunkering" which means the act of storing or supplying fuel, particularly for ships.
