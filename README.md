        PETROLBUNK:
        <br>
        "Petrol bunk" is a colloquial term used in India to refer to a petrol pump, which is a facility where petrol and other fuels are sold to the public.
        The word "bunk" is derived from the British English word "bunkering" which means the act of storing or supplying fuel, particularly for ships.

        PALACE:
        <br>
        A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop.[1] The word is derived from the Latin name palƒÅtium, for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences.[1] Most European languages have a version of the term (palais, palazzo, palacio, etc.), and many use it for a wider range of buildings than English. In many parts of Europe, the equivalent term is also applied to large private houses in cities, especially of the aristocracy; often the term for a large country house is different. Many historic palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments, museums, hotels, or office buildings. 
        The word is also sometimes used to describe a lavishly ornate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions[1] such as a movie palace.
